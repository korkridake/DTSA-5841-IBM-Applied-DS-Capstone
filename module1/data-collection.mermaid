/**
 * This flowchart represents the data collection process for the SpaceX API project.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Start the process.
 * 2. Import necessary libraries for the project.
 * 3. Define auxiliary functions to support data processing and API interaction.
 * 4. Fetch launch data from the SpaceX API.
 * 5. Parse the JSON response into a DataFrame for structured data handling.
 * 6. Filter and clean the data to ensure accuracy and relevance.
 * 7. Perform API calls using the defined auxiliary functions.
 * 8. Store the results from the API calls into lists for further processing.
 * 9. Create the final DataFrame by consolidating the processed data.
 * 10. End the process.
 * 
 * This flow ensures a systematic approach to collecting, processing, and organizing
 * data from the SpaceX API for further analysis.
